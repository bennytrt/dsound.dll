# dsound.dll
dsound.dll fixed a problem when u try to put in a trainer into youre main directory of gta iv (but fixes other also other issue's)
if u get a issue when u putted a trainer in the main file directory of grand theft auto 4 and u get this issue but the dsound.dll already exists just replace that one
with this one and it will fix youre problem (chance that youre trainer wont work if u use the most current version of gta iv)
